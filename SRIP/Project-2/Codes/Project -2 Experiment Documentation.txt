Process Followed to convert the experiment 
1. Understand the assigned experiment Java simulation on vlab.co.in using an old browser version and jre 
2. Understanding the experiment concept 
3. Developing the Algorithm 
4. Re-implement the same in javascript




Value Added by our Project
1. It would be beneficial for engineering students 
2. Highly beneficial for tier 2 and tier 3 college students who can use this to learn and understand the concept of perception learning.


Risks and Challenges :
1. Printing the grid fully into the Canvas for any no. of rows and columns.
2. Overcoming Mathematical Issues that on which conditions there could  be 1/0 and infinity cases.
3. Wrong Inputs Given By the User


Issues : 
        None Currently
